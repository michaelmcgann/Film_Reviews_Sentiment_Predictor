# Film_Reviews_Sentiment_Predictor
In this project, I utilize a dataset comprising text-based reviews to construct various predictive models. 
After training these models on a subset of the data, they aim to accurately classify a review as either positive or negative.

More info about the dataset can be found here http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.

This project was part of a challenge on the Udemy course "Python for Machine Learning and Data Science"

This project was particularly engaging, and I dedicated significant time to not only understanding the core concepts,
but also exploring additional elements beyond the original scope. I believe these extra efforts have enriched my learning experience and enhanced the final outcome.
